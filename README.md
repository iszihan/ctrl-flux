### Ctrl-FLUX 

This repo is my attempt to re-implement methods that make FLUX more controllable in the diffusers style, and hopefully to contribute back to diffusers after careful evaluation. The methods included for now are
- IP-Adapter [[Ye et al. 2023]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06721)
- OminiControl [[Tan et al. 2025]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15098)
